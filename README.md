# letsC

This repository is/will be a collection of programs/exercises that I've composed while learning C.

## Sources

* Programming Language. 2nd Edition Book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie

## Compiling

While making the programs, I used

```sh
cc <program>.c -o <program>
```

Also, I added the exercise text in the program, so to have a reference what the program should do.
